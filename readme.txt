I have created an react app and a server side app using node and express.js

The react is running on localhost:3000
and the node server is running on localhost:3001
mongodb runsn on default 27017 


for running it first run the react app:
	1. open admitkard-assignment folder in cmd
	2. run npm install
	3 run npm start

then start the mongodb server by running mongod command in another cmd.

then run the server:
	1. open another cmd and open Admitkard_server folder
	2. run npm install
	3. run node index.js

Now u can use the app in browser.
